# Industry Primer — Telco

> **Canon — see [AGENTS.md § 2.2](../../../../AGENTS.md#22--reference-data-files-are-canon--do-not-normalize).**
> Do not normalize the published shorthand documented here.

A starting-point cheat sheet for the `research-company` skill when
the target is a telecommunications operator (fixed-line, mobile,
wholesale, carrier, or data-centre / connectivity provider).

## Sub-segments

| Sub-segment | Examples | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier-1 incumbent** | BT, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefónica, NTT, AT&T, Verizon | Retail + wholesale + mobile + enterprise. Heavy regulator load. |
| **Mobile-led MNO** | Vodafone, T-Mobile US, KDDI, MTN | Spectrum-heavy; tower/rAN angle prominent. |
| **B2B / wholesale** | Colt Technology Services, Lumen, Zayo, NTT GDC, GTT, euNetworks | Fibre + colo + IP transit. Less retail; capital-markets-grade SLAs. |
| **Cable / hybrid** | Comcast, Liberty Global, Charter, Virgin Media O2 | Coax + fibre + content. |
| **Tower-co / infraco** | Cellnex, American Tower, Crown Castle, IHS Towers | Passive infrastructure only; landlord model. |
| **MVNO / virtual** | Lycamobile, Lebara, Boost | Buys capacity wholesale, owns brand + BSS. |

Choose sub-segment first; it drives the entire org-chart shape.

## Canonical functions

| Function id | display_name | importance heuristic |
|---|---|---|
| `network-ops` | Network Operations | **hero** for any operator |
| `customer-success` | Customer Success | **hero** for B2B-led operators |
| `wholesale-sales` | Wholesale & Carrier Sales | core (often split from enterprise sales) |
| `enterprise-sales` | Enterprise Sales | core |
| `consumer-sales` | Consumer Sales | core (Tier-1 incumbents) — skip for B2B-only |

## Sources of record

When researching a telco for this primer's slots:

- **Annual report / capital-markets day PDF** on the company's own
  site → ownership, size, strategic themes, leadership.
- **National registry** for subsidiaries (Companies House / SEC /
  Handelsregister / Infogreffe).
- **Wikipedia** for history, acquisitions, ASN.
- **The company's own ASN page on `bgp.tools`** or `peeringdb.com` →
  ASN, peering policy, prefix count.
- **Vendor case-study pages** for stack signal — Amdocs / Netcracker /
  Cisco / Microsoft / Salesforce all publish logo walls.
- **Trade press** — Light Reading, TelecomTV, Capacity, Total Telecom,
  Fierce Telecom, Telecom Asia → leadership commentary, transformation
  programmes, recent narrative arcs.
